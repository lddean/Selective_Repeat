The code were written in JAVA.

Since the CPU type may be different, so sender, receiver and packet must be compiled.

To run sender, receiver and packet , do the following:

run "make"

then sender, receiver and packet will be compiled

Open 3 terminals and enter the program folder

run "./nEmulator <port1> <address> <port4> <port3> <address> <port3> <int> <int> <int>

run "java receiver <address> <port3> <port4> <file>"

run "java sender <address> <port1> <port2> <file"

then you can see the result
